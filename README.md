This repository implements a downscaling method to generate high-resolution NDVI maps using MODIS NDVI and Landsat-derived predictors via the XGBoost algorithm. The approach is based on the method from the paper:

Robinson et al. (2019) - Fusing MODIS with Landsat 8 data to downscale weekly normalized difference vegetation index estimates for central Great Basin rangelands, USA

üåè Study Area
Location: Thanh H√≥a Province, Vietnam

Period: [Specify your MODIS/Landsat date range]

Target: Enhance spatial resolution of MODIS NDVI from ~250m to Landsat resolution (~30m)

üì¶ Input Data
MODIS NDVI

Landsat 8 derived indices: EVI, SAVI, NBR, DEM, Slope

GLCM texture metrics from EVI/SAVI/NBR (variance, entropy, etc.)

üß† Method
Extract training points (MODIS NDVI + Landsat predictors) in Google Earth Engine

Train an XGBoost regression model on 5,000 samples

Apply the model to full-resolution predictors to generate downscaled NDVI

Compare results with MODIS NDVI

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
Google Earth Engine (data preprocessing)

Python, XGBoost, Rasterio, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
